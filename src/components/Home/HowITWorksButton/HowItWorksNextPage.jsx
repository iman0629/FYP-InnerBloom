              InnerBloom is designed to meet you exactly where you are. No complicated forms, no judgment — 
              just a safe, private space powered by empathetic AI. Whether you're feeling overwhelmed, 
              curious, or ready for deeper support, we guide you gently every step of the way using 
              evidence-based techniques like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Everything is 
              confidential, available 24/7, and tailored to you.

                Start by simply telling us how you're feeling — through easy text chat or voice input 
                (hands-free when you need it). No pressure to explain everything at once. Just type 
                or speak naturally, like talking to a caring friend.

                Right away, InnerBloom analyzes your words, tone (if voice), and patterns to detect 
                your current emotional state — whether it's stress, low mood, worry, or something else. 
                If needed, we ask a quick, non-intrusive check-in question to get a clearer picture.
